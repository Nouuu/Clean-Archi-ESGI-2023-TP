# Testing Strategy

* Status: Accepted

* Deciders: Noé Larrieu-Lacoste Pierre Ebrahim Rémy Mashavoine Swann HERRERA

* Date: 2023-02-17

## Context and Problem Statement

We are at the start of the project. We are 4 and we code simultaneously.
We have take time to think about design decision.


## Decision Drivers

* time

* context

* the lack of stability of the project at its beginning.

* the duration of the project

## Considered Options

* TDD

* Test after

* No testing

## Decision Outcome

We chose to test after at the start, I think we will switch to TDD later. If the project continues.

### Positive Consequences

* Faster development

* We can break things and change our mind about how things should works.

### Negative Consequences

* We may realize bugs later (too late)
 
* we can fall into the trap of coupling our code to the implementation
